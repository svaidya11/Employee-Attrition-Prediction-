# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Employee Attrition Prediction using ML
The use case: employee attrition
This use case takes HR data and uses machine learning models to predict what employees will be more likely to leave given some attributes. Such model would help an organization predict employee attrition and define a strategy to reduce such costly problem.

The steps we will go through are:

Importing libraries
Data exploration
Data cleaning
Splitting data (train test split)
Model development applying 6-ML algorithms
Logistic Regression
Decision tree
KNN
SVM
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Saving model
